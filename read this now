hello for install metatrader on raspberry pi you need to install x86 os

for raspberry pi developper provide 2 x86 enviroment what i know

first android and one more windows 10/11

so if you wanna install mete trader on raspberry pi you need to choose what os you want to use

for your information if you wanna run x86 enviromant you need to use ssd cause x86 enviromant is verry slow

ok let i tell you about this tow os

android
what i like when i using android to running mt4 is its running good but
when i want to open mete editor if i want to use caps i need to hold my caps lock button

windows
what i like with when i using windows is i can use all off windows software not like android
android just can run .exe program only
but windows can rul all of that
what i didt like when i using windows is i can connect wifi

so 2 of that os can run metatrader but
tow of that still have problems that you need to make dissiction what os you want to use

so now how to install metatrader on that software?

ok now i will tell you how
android

install android 11(konstakang) on your raspberry pi
but batter you use android 9 cause much bater performance
dont use android 12,13,14

after you install android you need to root your android on raspberry pi
cause mt4 need root access for batter perfomance
for rooting you can use magisk

after you done rooting your android first off all i want you all install t-ui launcher
cause i want you fell like you didnt use android
you can set t-ui launcher for default launcher
